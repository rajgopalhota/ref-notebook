## What is Git?

Git is a **distributed version control system** that helps developers track changes in their code, collaborate with team members, and manage different versions of their projects. Think of it as a sophisticated "save system" for your code that remembers every change you make.[^1]

**Simple Analogy**: Imagine Git as a filing cabinet in your office where every document (code file) has a complete history of all changes made to it, who made them, and when.[^2]

### Why Use Git in Corporate Environment?

- **Track Changes**: See exactly what changed, when, and who made the change
- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously
- **Backup**: Your code is stored in multiple places (local, remote repositories)
- **Rollback**: Easily return to previous versions if something breaks
- **Branching**: Work on different features independently


## Initial Setup and Configuration

### First-Time Setup

Before using Git, you need to configure your identity. This information will be attached to every commit you make.[^3]

```bash
# Check Git version
git --version

# Set your name (use your real name for corporate projects)
git config --global user.name "John Smith"

# Set your email (use your corporate email)
git config --global user.email "john.smith@company.com"

# Set default branch name to 'main' (modern standard)
git config --global init.defaultBranch main

# Check your configuration
git config --list
```

**Corporate Note**: Always use your corporate email address for work projects to maintain proper attribution and communication.

## Basic Git Commands

### 1. Creating and Initializing Repositories

#### Starting a New Project

```bash
# Create a new directory and initialize Git
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
git init
```


#### Copying an Existing Project

```bash
# Clone a repository from GitHub/GitLab
git clone https://github.com/company/project-name.git
cd project-name
```

**Corporate Scenario**: Your team lead assigns you to work on the "user-authentication" feature. You clone the company repository to start working.

### 2. Basic File Operations

#### Checking Status

```bash
# See which files are modified, staged, or untracked
git status
```


#### Adding Files to Staging Area

```bash
# Add a specific file
git add filename.js

# Add all files in current directory
git add .

# Add all JavaScript files
git add *.js

# Add files interactively (choose what to add)
git add -i
```


#### Committing Changes

```bash
# Commit with a message
git commit -m "Add user login functionality"

# Commit and add files in one command
git commit -am "Fix authentication bug"

# Commit with detailed message
git commit -m "Add user login functionality

- Implement email/password validation
- Add password encryption
- Create login API endpoint"
```

**Corporate Note**: Write clear, descriptive commit messages. Your future self and teammates will thank you.[^4]

### 3. Viewing History

```bash
# View commit history
git log

# View compact history
git log --oneline

# View history with graph
git log --graph --oneline

# View changes in a specific file
git log -p filename.js

# View commits by a specific author
git log --author="John Smith"
```


## Branching and Merging

### Understanding Branches

Think of branches as **parallel universes** of your code. You can work on different features in separate branches without affecting the main codebase.[^3]

### Basic Branch Operations

```bash
# List all branches
git branch

# Create a new branch
git branch feature/user-profile

# Switch to a branch
git checkout feature/user-profile

# Create and switch to a branch in one command
git checkout -b feature/user-profile

# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Delete a branch (after merging)
git branch -d feature/user-profile

# Force delete a branch (use carefully)
git branch -D feature/user-profile
```


### Corporate Branching Convention

```bash
# Feature branches
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
git checkout -b feature/payment-integration

# Bug fix branches
git checkout -b bugfix/login-error
git checkout -b hotfix/security-patch

# Release branches
git checkout -b release/v2.1.0
```


### Merging Branches

```bash
# Switch to target branch (usually main)
git checkout main

# Merge feature branch
git merge feature/user-profile

# Merge with a merge commit (preserves branch history)
git merge --no-ff feature/user-profile
```

**Corporate Scenario**: You finish developing the user profile feature. You merge it back to main branch so other developers can use your code.

## Remote Repository Management

### Working with Remote Repositories

```bash
# Add a remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/company/project.git

# View remote repositories
git remote -v

# Push to remote repository
git push origin main

# Push a new branch to remote
git push -u origin feature/new-feature

# Pull latest changes from remote
git pull origin main

# Fetch changes without merging
git fetch origin
```


### Corporate Remote Workflow

```bash
# Daily workflow: Start your day by pulling latest changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/dashboard-improvements

# Work on your code...
git add .
git commit -m "Improve dashboard loading speed"

# Push your branch to remote
git push -u origin feature/dashboard-improvements

# Create Pull Request via GitHub/GitLab interface
```


## Corporate Git Workflows

### 1. Feature Branch Workflow (Most Common in Corporations)

This workflow uses separate branches for each feature, ensuring the main branch remains stable.[^5]

**Steps**:

1. Create feature branch from main
2. Work on feature
3. Push feature branch to remote
4. Create Pull Request
5. Code review and merge
```bash
# Developer workflow
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/customer-dashboard

# Work on feature...
git add .
git commit -m "Add customer dashboard with filters"
git push -u origin feature/customer-dashboard

# After code review and approval, merge via PR
```


### 2. GitFlow Workflow (For Larger Teams)

GitFlow uses multiple branches: main, develop, feature, release, and hotfix.[^6]

**Branch Structure**:

- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/***: Individual features
- **release/***: Prepare for production release
- **hotfix/***: Quick fixes for production

```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/shopping-cart

# Finish feature
git checkout develop
git merge feature/shopping-cart
git branch -d feature/shopping-cart

# Create release
git checkout -b release/1.2.0 develop
# Test and bug fixes...
git checkout main
git merge release/1.2.0
git tag -a v1.2.0
```


### 3. GitHub Flow (Simplified)

Simple workflow where everything merges to main branch.[^5]

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/user-notifications

# Work and commit
git commit -m "Add email notifications"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/user-notifications
```


## Advanced Git Operations

### 1. Stashing (Temporary Storage)

When you need to quickly switch branches but aren't ready to commit:

```bash
# Save current work temporarily
git stash

# Save with a message
git stash save "Work in progress on user login"

# List all stashes
git stash list

# Apply most recent stash
git stash apply

# Apply specific stash
git stash apply stash@{2}

# Remove stash after applying
git stash pop

# Delete a stash
git stash drop stash@{1}

# Clear all stashes
git stash clear
```

**Corporate Scenario**: You're working on a feature when your boss asks you to fix an urgent bug. You stash your current work, fix the bug, then return to your feature.

### 2. Rebasing (Advanced)

Rebasing rewrites commit history to create a cleaner project timeline:

```bash
# Rebase your feature branch onto main
git checkout feature/user-profile
git rebase main

# Interactive rebase to clean up commits
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Rebase and push (be careful with shared branches)
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/user-profile
```

**Corporate Warning**: Only use `--force-with-lease` on branches you own. Never force push to shared branches like main or develop.

### 3. Cherry-picking

Apply specific commits to another branch:

```bash
# Apply a specific commit to current branch
git cherry-pick abc123def

# Cherry-pick multiple commits
git cherry-pick abc123def def456ghi

# Cherry-pick without committing (for review)
git cherry-pick --no-commit abc123def
```

**Corporate Scenario**: You made a critical bug fix in your feature branch that needs to go to production immediately. You cherry-pick just that commit to the main branch.

### 4. Tagging Releases

```bash
# Create annotated tag for release
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release version 1.2.0"

# List all tags
git tag

# Push tags to remote
git push origin --tags

# Checkout a specific tag
git checkout v1.2.0
```


## Conflict Resolution

### Understanding Merge Conflicts

Conflicts occur when Git can't automatically merge changes. This happens when:

- Two people modify the same line of code
- One person deletes a file while another modifies it
- Changes are made to the same section of code


### Resolving Conflicts Step-by-Step

1. **When conflict occurs**:
```bash
git merge feature/new-feature
# Auto-merging index.html
# CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html
# Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

2. **Check conflicted files**:
```bash
git status
# On branch main
# You have unmerged paths.
# Unmerged paths:
#   both modified:   index.html
```

3. **Open conflicted file**:
```html
<<<<<<< HEAD
<h1>Welcome to Our Corporate Website</h1>
=======
<h1>Welcome to Our Company Portal</h1>
>>>>>>> feature/new-feature
```

4. **Resolve conflict** by choosing or combining changes:
```html
<h1>Welcome to Our Corporate Portal</h1>
```

5. **Mark as resolved and commit**:
```bash
git add index.html
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in index.html"
```


### Corporate Conflict Resolution Best Practices

- **Communicate**: Talk to the other developer before resolving
- **Test**: Always test the merged code
- **Review**: Have someone else review complex conflict resolutions
- **Prevent**: Pull frequently to minimize conflicts


## Best Practices for Corporate Teams

### 1. Commit Message Standards

Use conventional commit format:

```bash
# Format: <type>(<scope>): <subject>
git commit -m "feat(auth): add two-factor authentication"
git commit -m "fix(api): resolve user data validation error"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation instructions"
git commit -m "refactor(database): optimize user query performance"
```

**Types**:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Code formatting
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks


### 2. Branch Naming Conventions

```bash
# Feature branches
feature/user-authentication
feature/payment-integration
feature/dashboard-redesign

# Bug fixes
bugfix/login-validation
bugfix/memory-leak-fix

# Hotfixes (urgent production fixes)
hotfix/security-vulnerability
hotfix/payment-processing-error

# Release branches
release/v2.1.0
release/q4-2024
```


### 3. .gitignore for Corporate Projects

Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude sensitive and unnecessary files:

```gitignore
# Dependencies
node_modules/
vendor/

# Environment variables (contains secrets)
.env
.env.local
.env.production

# Build outputs
dist/
build/
*.min.js

# IDE files
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp

# Operating system files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Logs
*.log
logs/

# Database files
*.db
*.sqlite

# API keys and certificates
*.pem
*.key
config/secrets.json
```


### 4. Pull Request Guidelines

**Before Creating PR**:

```bash
# Update your branch with latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/your-feature
git merge main

# Run tests
npm test
# or
python -m pytest

# Push updated branch
git push origin feature/your-feature
```

**PR Description Template**:

```markdown
## What does this PR do?
Brief description of changes

## How to test?
Step-by-step testing instructions

## Screenshots (if applicable)
Before/after images

## Checklist
- [ ] Code follows company style guidelines
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed
```


## Common Corporate Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Emergency Hotfix

**Situation**: Critical bug in production needs immediate fix.

```bash
# 1. Create hotfix branch from main (production)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/payment-processing-fix

# 2. Fix the bug
# Edit files...
git add .
git commit -m "fix(payment): resolve processing timeout issue"

# 3. Push and create emergency PR
git push -u origin hotfix/payment-processing-fix

# 4. After approval, merge to main and develop
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/payment-processing-fix
git push origin main

# 5. Also merge to develop branch
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/payment-processing-fix
git push origin develop

# 6. Tag the hotfix
git tag -a v1.2.1 -m "Hotfix: payment processing timeout"
git push origin --tags
```


### Scenario 2: Code Review Feedback

**Situation**: Reviewer requests changes to your PR.

```bash
# 1. Make requested changes locally
git checkout feature/user-dashboard

# 2. Edit files based on feedback
# Make changes...

# 3. Add and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "address code review feedback: improve error handling"

# 4. Push updates (this updates the existing PR)
git push origin feature/user-dashboard
```


### Scenario 3: Collaborative Feature Development

**Situation**: Multiple developers working on the same large feature.

```bash
# Main feature branch
git checkout -b feature/e-commerce-integration

# Developer 1: Payment module
git checkout -b feature/payment-module feature/e-commerce-integration

# Developer 2: Inventory module
git checkout -b feature/inventory-module feature/e-commerce-integration

# When modules are complete, merge back to main feature branch
git checkout feature/e-commerce-integration
git merge feature/payment-module
git merge feature/inventory-module
```


### Scenario 4: Recovering Lost Work

**Situation**: Accidentally deleted commits or need to recover old code.

```bash
# View all commits (including "lost" ones)
git reflog

# Recover a specific commit
git checkout abc123def

# Create new branch from recovered commit
git checkout -b recovery/lost-work

# Find deleted branch
git reflog | grep "branch-name"
git checkout -b recovered-branch abc123def
```


### Scenario 5: Release Management

**Situation**: Preparing and managing a release.

```bash
# 1. Create release branch
git checkout develop
git checkout -b release/v2.0.0

# 2. Version bump and final preparations
# Update version numbers, documentation...
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 2.0.0"

# 3. Merge to main and tag
git checkout main
git merge release/v2.0.0
git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Release version 2.0.0"

# 4. Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge release/v2.0.0

# 5. Push everything
git push origin main develop --tags

# 6. Clean up release branch
git branch -d release/v2.0.0
git push origin --delete release/v2.0.0
```


### Scenario 6: Working with Large Files

**Situation**: Need to handle large files (videos, datasets) efficiently.

```bash
# Install Git LFS (Large File Storage)
git lfs install

# Track large file types
git lfs track "*.mp4"
git lfs track "*.zip"
git lfs track "*.psd"

# Add .gitattributes file
git add .gitattributes

# Add and commit large files normally
git add large-video.mp4
git commit -m "add product demo video"
git push origin main
```
